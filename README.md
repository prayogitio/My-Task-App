# My-Task-App
My first full stack MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJs, Angular2, NodeJs) program.
# About this app
This app is a simple My Task App that has a list of tasks and a search bar to help you find an item inside the list. You can also add new tasks and delete a task.
# How to install
Create a directory for this app. Use Git clone to get the content of this repository. Inside the "client" directory, build the content by running the "ng build --watch" command. This will update the "dist" folder. Then, use "cd .." to get out of client dir. Finally, run the server by using "nodemon server.js" command and go to your browser and hit the localhost:3000
